    | Modules with Routing Authority (Module Routing Engine)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This system, instead of taking routes and naming controller/method,
    | allows the modules listed below to inspect and "claim" a URI as its own.
    | For example, a site may have a standard page controller as well as an
    | extensive CMS/article plugin.  Pages might include /about-us, /contact-us,
    | etc. while articles might include /how-to-train-your-dragon/2019/08 or
    | /why-i-am-frustrated-with-star-wars.  The site developer may NOT want to
    | preface the articles with /articles/ and so Module Routing allows the module
    | that produced the URI (the articles) to claim it.
    | Now it's no longer a matter of regex routes but simply the module claiming
    | the $uri as its own.
    |
    | Obviously you can't have an article title and a page resolve to the same
    | value, but a little preventative coding on the creation end would avoid
    | the prefix `/articles` being needed - why have part of a url you don't
    | really need?
